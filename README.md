# Game Essentials in Java

## Overview
This is a **2D game** developed in **Java**, focused on implementing the **core mechanics** of a game rather than delivering a narrative-driven experience. The game showcases fundamental components such as:

- **Map System**
- **Collision Detection**
- **Object Interaction**
- **Game Loop Mechanics**
- **Network Requests**

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language
- **Google Gemini API**: Used for making network requests
- **Gson**: Utilized for parsing JSON responses and payloads
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management and project build

## Features
âœ… **Game World** â€“ A structured 2D environment with objects and interactive elements.  
âœ… **Collision System** â€“ Ensures proper physics-based interactions between objects.  
âœ… **Game Loop** â€“ Handles continuous game updates and rendering.  
âœ… **Network Integration** â€“ Uses Google Gemini for fetching external data.  
âœ… **JSON Parsing** â€“ Gson is used to serialize and deserialize data seamlessly.  

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:RidhaMuneer/2d-game.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
3. Ensure you have **Maven** installed.
4. Navigate to the project root and build the project:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
5. Run the game using:
   ```sh
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.game.App"
   ```

## Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Graphics** â€“ Adding textures and animations.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI Behavior** â€“ Implementing simple AI-driven entities.  
ðŸ”¹ **Expanded Network Features** â€“ Additional API integrations for dynamic content.  
ðŸ”¹ **Adding a Story** â€“ Making it a game that can be played.
